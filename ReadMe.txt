Sprint 6
Team: Hash Flag
Russell Ward
Owen Corrigan
Nicholas Hammm

To Run:
To run the JAR compiled by Intellij, enter the directory where the swe-project folder is located.
Then run;
java -jar swe-project/out/artifacts/swe.jar
If that fails try running the maven JAR from the same directory;
java -jar swe-project/target/swe-sprint6-jar-with-dependencies.jar

Note: The JARS will only work if you run them from outside the 'swe-project' directory/folder as the file paths
in application.properties unfortunately isn't working corrcetly.

Nicholas managed to get most of the code up and running. This represented the lions share of the work.
Owen got elements surrounding the reading of hashtags to assigning their 'gists'.
Russell worked on reading hashtags into hashmaps.
