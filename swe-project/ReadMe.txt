We had some issues with getting element 3b working, assigning stance based on the hashtags. Because of this the other elements based on test accuracy weren't finished.

Nicholas managed to get most of the code up and running. This represented the lions share of the work.
Owen got elements surrounding the reading of hashtags to and from text files working.
Russell worked on reading hashtags into hashmaps.

The jar is called swe.jar and located in the out\artifacts. If the JAR doesn't work, this weeks sprint can be run from swe-project\src\main\java\sweproject\graph\sprint5.
Run from the WriteHashtags java file.
